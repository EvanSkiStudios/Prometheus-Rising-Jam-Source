Jam Edition

https://youtu.be/Nw_cdqQHGA8

So yeah big fan of doom 1993, and having recently gotten into learning 3D in game maker, I decided (I WANT TO MAKE A DOOM CLONE)
So started out as learning 3D copying Wolfenstine 3D style, until I realized, this just wasnt working. Killed the whole project and restarted.
Code named EMBER, was my second attempt at a 3D code base to use and make 3D in game maker.
With the Jam coming up, and Alice's theme, I decided I wanted to use this "engine" for the jam game. 
So in a horrible pratice that even Valve will yell at you for. I made the engine around the game. EWWWW.
It runs at a nice and laggy 100-600 frames at most, the 3d collision takes 90% of the frame time.

Anyways, hope the game is fun, definitly going to keep at this after the jam, and hopefully it wont be such an unoptimized mess.

Stay tuned and Rip and tear!

Their might be a crash in rare moments when shooting, its rare, so please try the game again if it happens.
I think I might have fixed it but im unsure as like i said its a rare bug. Thanks.

==============HOW TO PLAY==================
So we will start with my games weirdness first

Didnt figure out look sensitivity through a slider so
if you press page up, the sensitivity will increase
page down will decreese sensitvity
Home will set it back to default

Tab will toggle between freeing and locking the mouse

F11 or alt+enter will toggle fullscreen

Keys are rebindable but they will reset each game launch...no save file for it sorry

defaults
wasd move
Mouse left to shoot
space to open doors
enter to select option in the menu
mosue scroll wheel will cycle through the weapon types
